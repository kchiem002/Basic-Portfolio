                Hello there, my name is Kathy Chiem (pronounced "CHEEM"). I am born and raised in Southern California
                to immigrant Vietnamese and Chinese parents. I have 2 younger siblings, Alex and Jeannie, and adorable
                furry children, Frosty (a male dog who thinks he is a cat) and Pepper (a male cat who thinks he is a dog or a human, and
                potties in a human toilet). 
                <br><br>Currently, I work full-time at a credit bureau, Experian. I know what
                you're thinking - no, we were not hacked, that was Equifax and no, we can't help you with your travel
                plans, that's Expedia. Speaking of travel plans, I love to travel with my boyfriend, who I have been with for almost 6 years
                now. Last year, we went to Europe, Mexico and Hawaii. 
                <br><br>In my free time, I like to make DIY things inspired by YouTube. I can also bake a mean cheesecake in any flavor. And like many Asian Americans, I like to participate in the act of "Karaoke" even though I sing terribly.
                <br><br>Recently, I spend my days learning to code and sometimes golf, so I guess you can say I am an amateur
                coder and golfer. Well anyway... if any of this sounds interesting to you, click around my site to learn more
                about me or contact me using my contact page. Thanks for reading!
